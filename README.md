# Wut

Running a simple dev environment and readying assets for production should
be super easy and trivial. This is an attempt at a basic template for
faster performing websites. Performance matters, but we shouldn't have
to constantly pick low-hanging fruit.

# Getting started

```git clone git@github:mrmrs/trim.git && cd trim && npm install```

### To run the development environment

```gulp```

### To minify assets for production

```gulp production```

## TODO

- Add image optimization
- Concat and minify all css/js files
- Csslint & JShint integration
- Integrate autoprefixer
- Integrate Livereload / server port
